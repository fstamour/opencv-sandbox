# Receipt parser

## Goal

Be able to take a scan, a photo or even a video of a receipt and extract 
information from it.

## Notes

Tested on archlinux with openCV 2.4 (the 3.0 is not already avaiable)

## Todo

- [ ] Use the github's issues to track "todos"
- [ ] Replace the makefile by a "SCON file" for portability and relative ease of use.
